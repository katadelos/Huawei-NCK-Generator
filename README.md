# Huawei NCK Generator

Huawei NCK Generator is a Python 3 implementation of the algorithm used by Huawei to create V1 Network Code Keys. The V1 algorithm was discontinued around 2012 and is mainly found in older 3G modems. 

## Checking modem lock status
- Modem lock status can be determined by issuing the `AT^CARDLOCK?` command over a serial connection.
- A locked modem will return ` ^CARDLOCK: 1,10,0`, whilst an unlocked modem will return ` ^CARDLOCK: 2,10,0`.
## Generating a Network Code Key
- If the modem is locked, a Network Code Key can be generated by the `nckGen.py` script, passing in a IMEI number as the first argument. The script will output a 8-digit number. This is your Network Code Key.
## Unlocking a modem
- The modem can be unlocked by issuing the `AT^CARDLOCK="00000000"` command, replacing `00000000` with the NCK that you have just generated.
